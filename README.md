# Learning Concurrency in Go [Notes By ChatGPT]

## Understanding Concurrency

### 1. What is Concurrency?

Concurrency is the ability of a program to manage multiple tasks at once. In Go, this is achieved through goroutines and channels, allowing different parts of a program to run independently yet potentially interact with each other.

**Example:**
Imagine you are cooking a meal. While waiting for the water to boil, you can chop vegetables. Both tasks (boiling water and chopping vegetables) are happening concurrently.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func boilWater() {
    fmt.Println("Boiling water...")
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Water boiled")
}

func chopVegetables() {
    fmt.Println("Chopping vegetables...")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Vegetables chopped")
}

func main() {
    go boilWater()
    go chopVegetables()

    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Meal preparation complete")
}
```

### 2. Concurrency vs Parallelism vs Multithreading

- **Concurrency:** Multiple tasks are in progress at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously. It's about dealing with multiple tasks at once, which can make programs more efficient by improving responsiveness and resource utilization.

- **Parallelism:** Multiple tasks are executed simultaneously. This requires multiple processors or cores. It's about performing multiple operations at the same time.

- **Multithreading:** A form of concurrency where a program is divided into multiple threads, each executing a part of the program simultaneously. Threads share the same memory space, which can lead to complications such as race conditions.

**Example:**

- **Concurrency:**
  Two people cooking different parts of a meal in the same kitchen.

- **Parallelism:**
  Two people cooking different parts of a meal in two separate kitchens simultaneously.

- **Multithreading:**
  A single chef preparing multiple parts of the meal simultaneously, with each task managed by a different thread.

### 3. Why Concurrency instead of Multithreading?

Concurrency is often preferred over multithreading for several reasons:
- **Simplicity:** Goroutines in Go are simpler to use and manage compared to traditional threads.
- **Efficiency:** Goroutines are lightweight and use fewer resources than threads.
- **Avoids Complexity:** Managing shared state and synchronization issues in multithreading can be complex and error-prone. Goroutines and channels provide a more straightforward way to handle these problems.

**Example:**

Using goroutines to handle multiple tasks concurrently without worrying about the complexities of thread management:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func printNumbers(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
    wg.Done()
}

func printLetters(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    for i := 'A'; i <= 'E'; i++ {
        fmt.Printf("%c\n", i)
    }
    wg.Done()
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    wg.Add(2)
    go printNumbers(&wg)
    go printLetters(&wg)
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Done")
}
```

### 4. Additional Important Concepts

- **Goroutines:** Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They are cheaper than system threads and are managed efficiently by the Go scheduler.

- **Channels:** Allow goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution. Channels can be used to pass data between goroutines safely.

- **Synchronization:** Tools like WaitGroups and Mutexes in Go help manage synchronization, ensuring that goroutines can work together without conflicts.

**Example of Goroutines and Channels:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    messages := make(chan string)

    go func() {
        messages <- "ping"
    }()

    msg := <-messages
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

# Goroutines in Golang

## 1. Goroutines in Golang (Basic to Advanced)

### Basics:

A goroutine is a function that runs concurrently with other functions. Goroutines are managed by the Go runtime, making them lightweight and efficient compared to traditional threads.

**Key Points:**

- **Main Goroutine:** Every Go program starts with a main goroutine, which is the entry point of the program (the `main` function).
- **Creating a Goroutine:** To start a new goroutine, use the `go` keyword followed by a function call.
- **Concurrency:** Goroutines run concurrently with the main goroutine and each other.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
}

func main() {
    go sayHello() // This starts the sayHello function as a goroutine
    time.Sleep(time.Second) // Sleep to give the goroutine time to complete
    fmt.Println("Hello from main goroutine!")
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The program starts with the main goroutine executing the `main` function.
- `go sayHello()` starts the `sayHello` function as a new goroutine.
- `time.Sleep(time.Second)` ensures the main goroutine waits for 1 second, giving the `sayHello` goroutine time to execute.

### Advanced Concepts:

- **Anonymous Goroutines:** You can start anonymous functions as goroutines.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Hello from anonymous goroutine!")
    }()
    time.Sleep(time.Second) // Sleep to give the anonymous goroutine time to complete
}
```

- **Multiple Goroutines:** You can start multiple goroutines, each running a separate function.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func task(id int) {
    fmt.Printf("Task %d started\n", id)
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("Task %d completed\n", id)
}

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        go task(i)
    }
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Sleep to give all goroutines time to complete
}
```

### Understanding Goroutine Lifecycle:

- **Creation:** A goroutine is created using the `go` keyword.
- **Execution:** The goroutine executes its function concurrently with other goroutines.
- **Termination:** The goroutine terminates when its function completes.

**Important Note:** If the main goroutine (main function) completes before other goroutines, the program will exit, and any remaining goroutines will be terminated abruptly.

## 2. `go` Keyword

The `go` keyword is used to start a new goroutine. When you prepend a function call with `go`, it runs that function concurrently as a separate goroutine.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printMessage(message string) {
    fmt.Println(message)
}

func main() {
    go printMessage("Hello, Go!")
    fmt.Println("This is the main function")
    // Adding a sleep to wait for the goroutine to complete (not ideal in real applications)
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `go printMessage("Hello, Go!")` starts the `printMessage` function as a new goroutine.
- The main function continues to execute concurrently, printing "This is the main function".

## 3. WaitGroups

**WaitGroups** are provided by the `sync` package and are used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing. They help ensure that the main function waits for all goroutines to complete before exiting.

### Using WaitGroups:

- **Add:** Increment the WaitGroup counter.
- **Done:** Decrement the WaitGroup counter (usually called with `defer`).
- **Wait:** Block until the WaitGroup counter is zero.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done() // Mark the goroutine as done when the function completes
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        wg.Add(1) // Increment the WaitGroup counter
        go worker(i, &wg)
    }

    wg.Wait() // Block until the WaitGroup counter is zero
    fmt.Println("All workers done")
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `wg.Add(1)`: Increments the WaitGroup counter.
- `defer wg.Done()`: Ensures that `wg.Done()` is called when the `worker` function completes, decrementing the counter.
- `wg.Wait()`: Blocks the main goroutine until the counter is zero, ensuring all `worker` goroutines have finished.
